      <p><strong>Ferguson and the University Community: August 2014 - December 2014</strong></p>
  <p>18-year-old Michael Brown, a reportedly unarmed African-American man of Ferguson, Missouri, was fatally shot Aug. 9 by police officer Darren Wilson. The event thrust the topic of policy brutality and racial prejudice into the national spotlight.</p>
<p>Members of the Charlottesville community responded to the event by holding protests and forums hosted by the police department such as <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/08/ferguson-charlottesville" target="_blank">“Can Ferguson Happen Here?”</a></p>
<p>BSA also held a <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/09/black-student-alliance-hosts-rally-against-police-brutality" target="_blank">Rally Against Police Brutality and Media Misrepresentation</a> in early September in which attendees walked the Lawn starting at Old Cabell Hall and stopped at various locations to hear speakers and members of the BSA talk about police brutality and racism generally and in Charlottesville.</p>
<p>The University NAACP chapter and the Black Student Alliance engaged in a variety of initiatives including a “Hands Up Don’t Shoot” photo campaign to a <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/12/black-student-alliance-hosts-candlelight-vigil-honoring-black-deaths" target="_blank">candlelight vigil</a> and solidarity march on the Downtown Mall.</p>
<strong><i><p>“This is an evil world, and evil things happen — and when they do, I need to call upon certain equipment and resources to keep us safe. But when it’s used, ask why.”</p><p>-Timothy Longo, Charlottesville Police Chief</p></i></strong>

    <p><strong>Hannah Graham Disappearance: September 2014</strong></p>
  <p>Second-year College student <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2015/01/semester-in-review-hannah-graham-disappearance” target="_blank">Hannah Graham was reported missing</a> Sept. 14 to the Charlottesville Police Department after friends and family had not heard from her since 1:20 a.m. on the morning of Sept. 13. A long <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/09/graham-investigation-timeline" target="_blank">investigation</a> by the Charlottesville Police Department and local search and rescue efforts led to the discovery and <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/11/medical-examiner-rules-hannah-graham-death-homicide" target="_blank">identification of her body</a> Oct. 24. Albemarle County resident Jesse Matthew was arrested in relation to the disappearance Sept. 24, with charges of abduction with intent to defile. Matthew has since been charged with first degree murder, to be prosecuted by Albemarle Commonwealth’s Attorney Denise Lunsford.</p> 
<p>Matthew is currently awaiting a June 8 trial in Fairfax for charges regarding a 2005 sexual assault. Matthew’s case in the disappearance of Graham will be scheduled for trial in a hearing on May 5. Matthew has pleaded not guilty in the Fairfax case.</p>
<p>Matthew is currently being held at the Albemarle - Charlottesville Regional Jail.</p>
<strong><i><p>“Having verified that Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr. has been charged in Albemarle County with the offense of abduction with the intent to defile as a result of events that allegedly occurred on September 13, 2014 in connection with the disappearance and death of Hannah Graham, the prosecution of him in the City of Charlottesville for that offense is duplicative and likely become barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. As a result, the Commonwealth has filed with the Charlottesville District Court a request for the entry of an order of nolle prosequi in Mr. Matthew's pending case in the City.</p><p>-Public release from Commonwealth's Attorney Dave Chapman</p></i></strong>

      <p><strong>Affordable Excellence: March 2015</strong></p>
  <p>This year the University <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/06/board-creates-new-affordable-excellence-subcommittee" target="_blank">Board of Visitors introduced</a> and approved <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2015/04/deconstructing-affordable-excellence" target="_blank">Affordable Excellence</a> — a multifaceted high-tuition high-aid financial model that aims to make the University more accessible to lower-income in-state students. The Board also increased funding for classroom technology and faculty salaries.The proposal passed in Board meetings on Mar. 24 and 25. </p>
<p>Starting in the 2015-16 academic year all in-state students will pay a 3.9 percent increase in tuition and all out-of-state students will pay an increase of 3.7 percent. All incoming in-state students also face a $1,000 step increase for the 2015-16 academic school year, and 2016-17 incoming students will be subject to an additional $1,000 step increase.</p>
<p>The plan initially was met with student opposition, including protests outside the Special Collections Library during a Board of Visitors session. In an effort to increase understanding about the model groups such as U.Va. Students United and United for Undergraduate Socioeconomic Diversity <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2015/04/university-student-groups-host-teach-in-discuss-affordable-excellence" target="_blank">hosted “teach-ins”</a> to push for transparency.</p>
<strong><i><p>“The University is affordable if people leave with the smallest amount of debt, so they defined affordability in terms of minimizing the amount of debt you have when you leave. Middle income families are typically left out of a lot of the financial aid discussion — we actually have a pretty generous program for middle-income families.”</p><p>-President <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2015/04/an-interview-with-president-sullivan-addressing-affordable-excellence" target="_blank">Teresa Sullivan</a></p></i></strong>
